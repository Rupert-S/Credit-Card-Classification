# Credit-Card-Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The classification is based on decision trees, leveraging transaction features to predict fraudulent activity with high accuracy.

## Model Overview

  - Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
  - Accuracy: 99.98% on test data
  - Dataset: A dataset of credit card transactions, labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.


## Project Workflow

  - Data Preparation: Preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and test sets.
  - Model Training: Using a Decision Tree to classify transactions.
  - Model Evaluation: Testing the model on unseen data to check its accuracy.
